![plot](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn/assets/86995074/d4e43900-eadb-4ddf-af46-0208314de41a)

### Dependent Packages
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A machine learning library for Python.
- **Bgolearn**: A Bayesian global optimization package for Material Design.

### UI Encapsulation
To encapsulate the user interface and create a standalone application, follow these steps:

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5 pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Package the application using PyInstaller:**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
   ```
   This command creates a single executable file from `main.py` without opening a console window.
